# Polymarket AI Hedge Agent

> **Built on top of [Polymarket/agents](https://github.com/Polymarket/agents) framework**

Automated trading and rebalancing agent for Polymarket prediction markets using a profit-locking hedging strategy with AI-driven decision making.

## Overview

This agent extends the official Polymarket Agents framework with a sophisticated hedging strategy that:
- **Takes profit** when probability rises above threshold (85%) by selling YES shares and hedging with NO shares
- **Cuts losses** when probability falls below threshold (78%) by exiting the position
- **Locks in gains** through mathematical hedging that guarantees profit regardless of final outcome
- **AI-enhanced decisions** (optional) using LLM to adjust thresholds based on news/sentiment

## Features

- ✅ Real-time market monitoring via Polymarket Gamma API
- ✅ Integration with official Polymarket Agents framework
- ✅ Automated profit-taking and stop-loss execution
- ✅ Mathematical hedging for guaranteed profit locking
- ✅ Position state persistence
- ✅ Detailed logging with Rich CLI interface
- ✅ Comprehensive test scenarios and backtesting
- ✅ PnL tracking (unrealized and locked)
- 🔄 AI/LLM integration for dynamic threshold adjustment (optional)

## Architecture

This project uses the Polymarket Agents framework and extends it with custom hedging logic:

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Polygon wallet with USDC
- Polymarket API access (optional for live trading)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd polymarket-agent

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
```

### Configuration

Edit `.env` file:

```env
# Required for Polymarket Agents
POLYGON_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key  # Optional: for AI features

# Network
POLYGON_RPC_URL=https://polygon-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/xxx
CHAIN_ID=137  # or 80002 for Amoy testnet

# Market
MARKET_CONDITION_ID=0x9c8f9e...  # Polymarket condition ID

# Strategy
TAKE_PROFIT_PROBABILITY=0.85
STOP_LOSS_PROBABILITY=0.78
HEDGE_SELL_PERCENT=1.0  # Recommended: sell 100% for maximum hedge
POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS=20
```

## Usage

### Run the Agent

```bash
python main.py
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Quick tests (recommended)
python3 test_quick.py

# Full test suite
python3 tests/test_strategy.py
python3 tests/test_position.py
```

### Use Official Polymarket Agents CLI

```bash
# Get markets
python scripts/python/cli.py get-all-markets --limit 10

# Execute official trade script
python agents/application/trade.py
```

## Strategy Logic

1. **Monitor**: Poll market every 15-20 seconds for current probability
2. **Evaluate**: Check if probability crosses take-profit (≥85%) or stop-loss (≤78%) thresholds
3. **Execute**:
   - **Take Profit**: Sell YES shares → Buy NO shares with proceeds → Lock profit
   - **Stop Loss**: Sell all shares → Exit position → Minimize loss
4. **Track**: Update position state and calculate PnL

### Hedging Math Example

```
Entry: 1250 YES @ $0.80 = $1000 invested

Price rises to 86% (TAKE PROFIT):
  Sell: 1250 YES @ $0.86 = $1,075
  Buy: 7,679 NO @ $0.14 = $1,075

Final outcomes:
  If YES wins: 0 * $1 = $0
  If NO wins: 7,679 * $1 = $7,679

Guaranteed profit: $7,679 - $1,000 = +$6,679 (if NO wins)
```

## Testing

See [tests/report.md](tests/report.md) for detailed test results. Test scenarios:
- **Scenario 1**: Profit-taking and hedging (80% → 85%)
- **Scenario 2**: Stop-loss execution (80% → 76%)
- **Scenario 3**: Hedge protection during crash (85% → 50%)
