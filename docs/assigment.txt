Assignment Title:
Build a Polymarket AI Agent for Automated Trading and Rebalancing
Assignment Description:
Develop an AI-driven agent capable of interacting with Polymarket prediction markets to manage user bets automatically. The agent should monitor market probabilities in real-time, book profits when odds move favorably, rebalance positions across both outcomes to hedge gains, and cut losses if the odds become unfavorable.
Using the example bet "Will Bitcoin go below 90k," with an initial bet of $1000 on "Yes" at 80% probability:
Automatically book profit on position when probability rises (e.g., from 80% to 85%) and rebalance the profit by betting on both "Yes" and "No."
Book losses and exit if the probability drops below a threshold (e.g., 78%).
Objectives:
Implement real-time odds tracking and data retrieval from Polymarket API.
Develop automated trade execution logic for profit booking and rebalancing.
Ensure risk management by defining and acting on loss thresholds.
Utilize wallet integration and secure transaction handling for placing bets.
Demonstrate the ability to hedge positions properly to protect profits.
Deliverables:
Source code implementing the AI agent.
Documentation explaining the architecture, API usage, and trading logic.
A test report showing sample trades with market movements, profit bookings, and rebalancing actions.
Optional: Discussion on potential risks, improvements, and scalability.
Evaluation Criteria:
Completeness and correctness of the automated trading logic.
Effective use of Polymarket API and secure wallet transactions.
Clear handling of profit booking, rebalancing, and loss management.
Quality of documentation and testing evidence.
Submission Details:
Submit your codebase via Git repository link or zipped folder.
Include a README with setup instructions and usage guide.
